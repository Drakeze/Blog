# TODO / Improvements

- [HIGH][Medium] Add form validation and server-side handling for the newsletter subscription endpoint to prevent invalid submissions and provide user-friendly errors.
- [MEDIUM][Medium] Create loading skeletons for featured posts and social feed sections to avoid layout shifts during client fetches.
- [MEDIUM][Low] Ensure all social links and external anchors include `rel="noopener noreferrer"` when `target="_blank"` is used.
- [LOW][Low] Add README badges for CI, lint, and formatting status once workflows are verified.
