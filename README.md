# 📝 Blog Platform

A full-stack blog platform built with **Next.js**, designed to aggregate and manage content from multiple external platforms while demonstrating modern frontend architecture, API integration, and production-ready workflows.

---

## 📌 Overview

This Blog Platform serves as a centralized system for managing and displaying content sourced from multiple external services.

It was built as part of my professional portfolio to demonstrate how I approach:

- Content-driven application design  
- Multi-source API integration  
- Scalable frontend architecture  
- Deployment-ready workflows  

The focus is on **clean data flow, maintainability, and real-world integration patterns**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Multi-platform content aggregation  
- External API integrations  
- Clerk authentication for admin access  
- Modern, responsive UI  
- Environment-based configuration  
- Deployed production build  

---

## 🌐 External Data Sources

This application integrates with multiple external platforms:

- **Patreon API** — membership-based and gated content  
- **LinkedIn API** — professional and long-form updates  
- **Reddit API** — community-driven discussions and posts  

These platforms require careful handling of authentication, rate limits, and data normalization.

## 🧠 Development Approach

This project follows a **tool-assisted, developer-led workflow**.

### UI Exploration & Mockups
- Layout inspiration and design exploration performed using **v0.dev**
- Used to establish a consistent visual direction and component structure
- Final UI implementation and integration completed manually  

🔗 [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)

### AI-Assisted Review & Baseline Validation
- Codex was used for code review, refactoring suggestions, and baseline checks
- Application logic, data flow, and architectural decisions were reviewed and validated by me  

### API Validation & Integration
- External API endpoints were tested and verified using **Postman**
- Authentication flows and response structures were validated prior to integration
- Each platform is handled through isolated integration logic
- Data normalization and consumption logic were implemented manually  

AI and tooling were used to **accelerate development and improve quality**, not replace engineering judgment.

> ## ▶️ Running the Project Locally
> 
> This project uses **Bun** as the runtime and package manager.
> 
> **Install Dependencies**
> ```bash
> bun install
> ```
> 
> **Start Development Server**
> ```bash
> bun dev
> ```
> 
> **Build for Production**
> ```bash
> bun run build
> ```
> 
> **Start Production Server**
> ```bash
> bun start
> ```

Environment variables are used to manage API credentials and configuration when running the project locally.

Authentication now uses Clerk. For local and production setup, provide:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `CLERK_ADMIN_EMAILS` or `CLERK_ADMIN_USER_IDS` to restrict admin access

Google sign-in should be enabled in the Clerk dashboard, and if this app is admin-only you should disable other providers and self-service sign-ups there.

## 🔄 How the Application Works

- Content is retrieved from external APIs (Patreon, LinkedIn, Reddit)  
- Each platform is handled through isolated integration logic  
- Data is normalized before being passed to UI components  
- Components consume structured content consistently  
- Environment variables manage authentication and configuration  
- The application is deployed with production-safe defaults  

---

## 📍 Current Status

- Core content aggregation implemented  
- Fully deployed and accessible  
- Actively maintained  

---

## 🧭 Planned Improvements

Future iterations may include:

- Backend persistence for cached content  
- Expanded content filtering and categorization  
- Additional platform integrations  
- Analytics and engagement tracking  

These enhancements are **planned but not yet implemented**.
